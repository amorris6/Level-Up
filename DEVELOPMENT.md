Got the repository open using openframework project generator 
and made a commit to check that it updates the correct repository.

Created a player class. Implemented a movement function and made
player change color when moving. Can't decide whether to keep
feature or not.

Added Vivaldi for background music. Worked on implementing
external library. It won't work. :( Apparently, ofBaseSoundPlayer
doesn't exist. That's fine. This is fine. Download for next
attempt will take an hour. It's 4am. Will try tomorrow.

No commits today. Only one type of commit I'm thinking about.
External libraries are a sham. ofxlibraries are old and 
outdated. Had the perfect library, but creator didn't test
in x64, only win32. Added looping to soundtrack, so I got
that going for me.

**11/20/2019**
:) Using ofxSmartFont. Isn't necessary, but should streamline
the process if I want to use different fonts. Working on creating
different levels. ofxButtons are useless, will make my own, hopefully
tonight or tomorrow.
